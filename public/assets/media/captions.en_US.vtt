Landsat 9: Continuing the Legacy

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.180
Danielle Rappaport: When you think of a healthy tropical forest,

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.850
you think of a cacophony of bird sounds at dawn and dusk.

4
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.620
I don't know if, you know, if you've been to one of those really deafening tropical forests where

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.830
you can't really hear yourself think.

6
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.600
We didn't really hear that.

7
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.510


8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.380
(on-screen text) Episode Four: Plays Well with Others

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.510
And so I think the one thing that’s so powerful about acoustic data

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.690
is kind of the visceral appreciation for how, for change

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.650
when you can actually hear the silence, you know?

12
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.880
Narrator: Dr. Danielle Rappaport is a forest ecologist who uses nature sounds

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.980
to measure the health of the Amazon rainforest.

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.090


15
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.630
Landsat has allowed us to map those changing dynamics

16
00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.300
and get a really wonderful objective annual time series of

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.940
how humans have been modifying the Amazon forest.

18
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.420


19
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.710
Narrator: Landsat helped Danielle and her team target areas of human activity

20
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.100
bumping up against the Amazon forest, a region known as the “frontier”. 

21
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.500
From there, she used bio-acoustics to assess

22
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.920
the effects of human activity on wildlife.

23
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.290
Danielle Rappaport: So that was - Landsat was really the backbone of this study.

24
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.360
Narrator: Danielle is one of thousands of scientists that has paired Landsat data

25
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.110
with an entirely different dataset to uncover a more nuanced understanding of the world.

26
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.470
In many cases, one set of data can tell you what is happening,

27
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.370
while Landsat can tell you why it’s happening.

28
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.980


29
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.380
Jeff Masek: So the, the case that we always look at is, is the Middle East

30
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.080
where pivot irrigation has led to a depletion of groundwater

31
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.660
Narrator: Basically what that means is, the NASA satellite GRACE picked up

32
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.910
some strange readings in the Middle East that indicated their groundwater

33
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.100
had suddenly decreased by an alarming amount.

34
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.100
Landsat later revealed the cause via images of the land surface.

35
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.140
Over the past several decades, Saudi Arabia had begun to

36
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.040
employ a method of irrigation that was so water intensive,

37
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.740
it literally changed the Earth’s gravitational pull in that particular region.

38
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.720
These partnerships between satellites sound great.

39
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.030
After all, teamwork makes the dreamwork.

40
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.720
But how do you make two different data sets from two different satellites sing? 

41
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.790
Here’s the secret.

42
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.290
Different data sets are complementary, and not in competition.

43
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.500


44
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.060
See, Landsat data tells us about local conditions on the land surface.

45
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.410
Forests, neighborhoods, farms, deserts, farms in deserts…

46
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.740
Meanwhile, GRACE gives a broad, regional view of water levels underground.

47
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.900
Using the two together deepens our understanding of the world,

48
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.610
letting us see what causes led to which effects.

49
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.480
But GRACE is not the only partner for Landsat.

50
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.200
The European Sentinel-1 uses radar to see through the clouds that block Landsat’s view,

51
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.060
while Landsat reveals the colors and characteristics of the surface.

52
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.250
And NASA's GEDI uses laser pulses to

53
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.090
measure the height of trees and help map the biomass of a forest.

54
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.840
This nicely complements Landsat’s view of the canopy top,

55
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.700
which assesses the health of the trees.

56
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.900
Not to mention the long data record that lets us track changes over decades.

57
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.210
Landsat is also a great complement to other, similar land imagers.

58
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.470
In fact, our friend Jeff has done a lot of work

59
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.110
to harmonize Landsat and Sentinel-2 data.

60
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.450
Back to you, Jeff.

61
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.250
Jeff Masek: Sentinel-2 is very much like Landsat.

62
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.700
It's a Landsat-like system that the European Union has fielded since 2015.

63
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.180
And so the real key there is putting Landsat and Sentinel together because,

64
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.860
increasingly what people are looking for is a daily observation at that kind of resolution.

65
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.160


66
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.310
You know, there's been a, almost an explosion in the, in the number of earth resources satellites,

67
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.330
earth observation satellites that are out there in the international community.

68
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.590
In addition to Sentinel-2, India, Brazil, China, Thailand,

69
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.680
they all have their own earth observation programs.

70
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.360
Increasingly it's about putting all of that together and harmonizing the data

71
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:12.000
or at least using them in time series kinds of ways, to really accelerate the use.

72
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.920


73
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.350
Narrator: What does it mean to be worthy of legacy?

74
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.840
Eight generations of Landsat satellites have quietly observed a changing earth

75
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.390
from 438 miles above for almost 50 years.

76
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.520
Like most things worth doing, it hasn’t been easy.

77
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.100
Jeff Masek: I think Landsat program today

78
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.590
is probably healthier than it's been a very long time.

79
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.940
We have two operational satellites on orbit now

80
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.900
Landsat 9 will join the fleet in 2021.

81
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.380
And then in the late 2020s we'll have the Landsat NEXT system coming up.

82
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.540
We doing exactly know what that’s going to look like yet,

83
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.010
but the planning is in place and I'm confident that is going to be there.

84
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.290


85
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.560
Narrator: Born during a time of limited technology,

86
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.620
Landsat’s founders were dreamers who laid the foundation for limitless future innovation.

87
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.040
As we change, so do our forests, farms, cities and suburbs.

88
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.200
It’s a mission that spans generations

89
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.150
and one that we can rely on to tell us what’s actually going on

90
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.600
when the surface of our planet goes through transformations.

91
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.880
Now we’re launching Landsat 9, the continuation of that dream.

92
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.070
We’ve enlisted our best and brightest to work on this decades-long mission

93
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.350
and we will for decades to come.

94
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.350
Fifty more years of Earth data in the future?

95
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.740
We’ll see you there.

96
