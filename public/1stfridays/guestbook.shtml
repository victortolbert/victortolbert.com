<b>Great Site, very informative and helpful. I've been told 

the First Friday held in Dallas was more a club atmosphere

rather than a place to network.  I haven't heard anything 

lately if it currently still exits.  I would like more 

information on restarting it.  </b><br>

FF/Washington, DC and recently moved to LA and would like 

to have a contact name for the FF/LA.  Also, if all FF 

organizations would have homepages this would be helpful for 

finding more progressive African Americans networking and 

doing positive things.  God Bless and Peace!!
