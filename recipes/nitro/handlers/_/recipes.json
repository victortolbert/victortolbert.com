mixing bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of corn starch, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of ground white pepper,  1/2 teaspoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of Maggie Seasoning Sauce or Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons of Shaoxing Huatiao wine and 2 tablespoons of sesame oil.\nRoughly chop 80g of water chestnuts into fine pieces. I used canned ones.\nChop 4 large Chinese mushrooms into fine pieces too.\nAdd the water chestnuts and mushrooms to the pork mixture. Mix all the ingredients well to combine.\nFinely dice a small carrot. These will be placed on top each pork siew mai to garnish. Use salmon roe or salted egg yolk if preferred.\nSet aside the pork mixture and the diced carrots till ready to wrap dumplings.\n\nTo make the glutinous rice filling -\nSoak 2 lap cheongs (Chinese sausages) in boiling water until the skin is separated from the meat. Remove the skin from the lap cheong and cut them into small dices.\nIn a large sauce pan over medium-high heat, pan fry the lap cheong dices until they are golden but not brown. They should be a lovely red.\nFollow the instructions at Glutinous Rice in Lotus Leaf (http://cooking.storyofbing.com/2010/07/glutinous-rice-in-lotus-leaf-2/) and prepare the glutinous rice. Once the rice and other ingredients are stir fried till fragrant, add the pieces of fried lap cheong and set aside to cool.\n\nPrepare the ingredients necessary for the wrapping of the dumplings.\nStart by placing a sheet of wonton wrapper on a flat surface. Place a small teaspoon of filling in the centre of the wonton wrapper.\nDap finger in some water and gently wet the sides of the wonton wrapper.\nGather the wonton wrapper with the filling in the palm of hand and squeeze gently while folding the wrapper skin upwards and against the filling so that the wonton wrapper wraps the filling tightly.\nMake sure the dumplings are tight. Otherwise they may fall apart while being steamed. Use more water to seal them if necessary.\nPlace a large shrimp on the top of each pork siew mai.\nAdd a few pieces of chopped carrot or salmon roe or salted egg yolk to add a fresh colour to the dumpling.\nDo the same for the glutinous rice siew mai, adding more lap cheong pieces on the top if preferred.\nPlace the dumplings in a steamer lined with baking paper. Cut some holes through the baking paper to let the steam through.\nPlace the steamer over boiling water for 14-15 minutes or until the filling is cooked.\nServe hot.\nUncooked dumplings may be frozen and steamed at a later date. Dust some flour in a container so that the dumplings wont stick to it."},{"id":634300,"title":"Barbecued Corn on the Cob With Spiced Butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/634300-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":4,"readyInMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/BNKJW2JQ/barbecued-corn-on-the-cob-with-spiced-butter","sourceName":"Foodista","summary":"Barbecued Corn on the Cob With Spiced Butter takes roughly <b>45 minutes</b> from beginning to end.

Put the rest of the veggies and fruit in the cavity of the chicken.\nRoast for 30 minutes, until the breast is firm and just beginning to brown in spots. Using tongs, turn the chicken breast-down and roast for 20 minutes longer, until the skin is lightly browned and the thermometer registers 175 to 180.\nTilt the chicken to drain the cavity juices into the pan and remove the goodies from the inside and bottom of pan.  Now transfer the bird to a cutting board. Remove the rack from the pan and spoon off the fat. Set the pan over high heat. Add the stock and cook, scraping up any browned bits and leftover pieces of goodies. Squeeze the last lemon to release the juices. Carve the chicken and pass the chunky jus at the table."},{"id":715563,"title":"Pierogi Casserole","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/715563-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":4,"readyInMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"http://www.pinkwhen.com/pierogi-casserole/","sourceName":"pinkwhen.com","summary":"You can never have too many main course recipes, so give Pierogi Casserole a try.

In a large pan over medium/high heat, cook the sausages until they are a nice golden brown. While cooking, break apart the mixture until it looks like ground meat.\nTake the meat out of the pan and save it in a bowl. Add 2 tbsp olive oil and add the sage to the pan. Cook for a minute, add the leeks & cayenne pepper. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes and put the meat back in the pan. When the leek is cooked, turn off the heat and keep in the mixture in the pan.\nFor the tomato sauce:\nIn a medium size pot over medium/ high heat, add 1 tbsp olive oil, thyme, garlic & onions. Cook for 3-4 minutes, until onions are translucent. Add crushed tomatoes, lower the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes (with a lose lid, otherwise the sauce will splatter all over your kitchen walls!) Add sugar and about 1 tsp kosher salt (1/2 tsp for regular salt), stir and cook for another 2 minutes. Puree the tomatoes until smooth. Add milk and butter, and stir. Keep the heat on very low or turn off until you are ready to serve.\nWhen rigatoni is cooked, add to the hot pan with the sausage mixture. Stir well, add a little olive oil if it looks dry. Plate and add tomato sauce to the pasta.
