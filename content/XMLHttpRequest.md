# XMLHttpRequest

XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.

Despite its name, XMLHttpRequest can be used to retrieve any type of data, not just XML.

If your communication needs to involve receiving event data or message data from a server, consider using [server-sent events](/server-sent-events) through the [EventSource](/EventSource) interface. For full-duplex communication, [WebSockets](/websockets-api) may be a better choice.
