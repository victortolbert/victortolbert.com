I'm a life-long learner, so Information Technology and Web development has been an awesome career path for me. Starting as a volunteer webmaster for friends, I'm now a self-taught, senior software engineer. I've spent too much time allowing imposter syndrome to get in the way. At least I used to. Having worked on excellent engineering teams at Autotrader.com, AT&T and others, with Computer Science graduates from top schools, especially Georgia Tech. I learned at lot on the job from those very smart guys. Through my diverse experience for the the past 15+ years, I've learned that there are many opinions and ways to accomplish the same goal. I was intimated by new terminologies and felt ill prepared with my business and sales background and training. Overwelmingly, the GT graduates were well prepared and represented the school positively.
