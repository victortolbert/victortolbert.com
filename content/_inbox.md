Zen:

- Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
- It's not fully shipped until it's fast
- Favor focus over features
- Keep it logically awesome
- Encourage flow
- Have a price
- Responsive is better than fast
- Non-blocking is better than blocking
- Mind your words, they are important
- Approachable is better than simple
- Anything added dilutes everything else
- Avoid administrative distraction
- Speak like a human
- Practicality beats purity
- Design for failure

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
