## 12 Commonly Recognized Composition Principles

1. **Rule of Thirds**: Divide the frame into a 3x3 grid, and place key elements along the grid lines or at their intersections to create balance and interest.
1. **Leading Lines**: Use natural or man-made lines within the scene to guide the viewer's eye towards the main subject.
1. **Framing**: Frame your subject with objects in the foreground to add depth and draw attention to the subject.
1. **Symmetry and Balance**: Create a sense of balance and harmony by arranging elements symmetrically or using asymmetry effectively.
1. **Filling the Frame**: Get close to your subject to eliminate distractions and focus on the subject's details.
1. **Rule of Odds**: Odd numbers of subjects (3, 5, 7, etc.) can create a more visually pleasing and balanced composition compared to even numbers.
1. **Leading Room**: Leave space in the direction your subject is looking or moving, providing context and a sense of direction.
1. **Depth and Layers**: Use foreground, middle ground, and background elements to create depth and dimension in your photographs.
1. **Patterns and Repetition**: Capture repeating shapes, colors, or textures to create visual interest.
1. **Contrast**: Highlight differences in color, tone, or texture to make your subject stand out.
1. **Golden Ratio**: Similar to the Rule of Thirds, the Golden Ratio is a mathematical principle that can help you position key elements in a visually pleasing way.
1. **Simplify**: Eliminate unnecessary clutter and distractions from your frame to keep the focus on your subject.
