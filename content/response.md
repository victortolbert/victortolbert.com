# Response

The `Response` interface of the [Fetch API](/fetch-api) represents the response to a request.

You can create a new Response object using the Response() constructor, but you are more likely to encounter a Response object being returned as the result of another API operationâ€”for example, a service worker FetchEvent.respondWith, or a simple fetch().
