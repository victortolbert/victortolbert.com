# Model View Controller

Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software design pattern[1] commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. These elements are the internal representations of information (the model), the interface (the view) that presents information to and accepts it from the user, and the controller software linking the two.[2][3]
