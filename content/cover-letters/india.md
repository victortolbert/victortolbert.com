I'm India Lyons, a dedicated educator with a passion for mathematics. With a decade of experience in the field of education, I've had the privilege of working with students ranging from Kindergarten to 8th grade. My journey has included roles as a tutor, after-school counselor, and director.

I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science with a minor in Economics from Howard University, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Arts in Teaching Middle Grades at Georgia State University.

This marks my inaugural year as a Math teacher at Stone Mountain Middle School, and I couldn't be more thrilled to engage with the exceptional young minds that Dekalb County has to offer.
