# Voice & Tone Guidelines

## Introduction

### Why do we need voice and tone guidelines?

To connect with our customers, we need to talk in a way that resonates with them. The right voice makes people feel at home through content that speaks their language.

### How is voice different from tone?

- **Voice** reflects our personality. It's _what_ we say.
- **Tone** is the way we speak. It's _how_ we say things.

Voice stays consistent across all of our content. Tone expresses the mood or feeling--which _should_ change base on your audience and the situation.
