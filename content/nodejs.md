Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write [command line tools](/cli) and for server-side scripting.
