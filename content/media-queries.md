# Media queries

The CSS media queries module enables testing and querying of viewport values and browser or device features, to conditionally apply CSS styles based on the current user environment. Media queries are used in the CSS `@media` rule and other contexts and languages such as HTML and JavaScript.

Media queries are a key component of [responsive design](/rwd). They enable conditional setting of CSS styles depending on the presence or value of device characteristics. It's common to use a media query based on viewport size to set appropriate layouts on devices with different screen sizes â€” for example three columns on a wide screen or a single column on a narrow screen.
