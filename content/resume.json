For example, at Videa he successfully defined our interface standards, implemented an online code base style guide, constructed our interfaces, and worked well with the UX team to create great user interactions.   Plus, without being asked he created a complete standalone demo application to ensure the company would have something functional to show at two NAB conferences.  This proactive approach was outstanding and helped the company close a few deals.\n\nBesides being talented UI professional, Victor is also a great person to work with.  Victor is very personable, funny, and has a positive team based approach to working.  \n\nI look forward to hiring and working with him again."
