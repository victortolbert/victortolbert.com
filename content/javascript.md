JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting [object-oriented](/programming#object-oriented-programming), [imperative](/programming#imperative-programing), and [declarative](/programming#declarative-programming) (e.g. functional programming) styles.
