# You Need a Budget (YNAB)

You Need a Budget (YNAB) is an American multi-platform personal budgeting program based on the envelope system. It is available via desktop computer or mobile app. The software was developed in 2004 by Jesse Mecham, while he was in college pursuing his master's degree in accounting after an experience where he and his wife had no money and needed to improve their budgeting. It evolved from a spreadsheet that he created for the budgeting process.

> Budgeting is simply the act of aligning your spending with your priorities. Think about whatâ€™s most important to you, assign every dollar to the most appropriate category, and then use that plan to guide your spending.
