A basic duality: The Web was originally conceived as a hypertextual information space, but the development of increasingly sophisticated front- and back-end technologies has fostered its use as a remote software interface. This dual nature has led to much confusion, as user experience practitioners have attempted to adapt their terminology to cases beyond the scope of its original application. The goal of this document is to define some of these terms within their appropriate contexts. and to clarify the underlying relationship among these various elements.

## Web as a software interface (task-oriented)

### Visual Design

Graphic treatment of interface elements (the "look" in "look-and-feel")

### Interface Design (As in traditional HCI)

Design of interface elements to facilitate user interaction with functionality

### Information Design (In the Tuftean sense)

Designing the presentation of information to facilitate understanding

### Interaction Design

Development of application flows to facilitate user tasks defining how the user interacts with site functionality

### Functional Specifications

"feature set": Detailed descriptions of functionality the site must include to meet user needs

### User Needs

Externally derived goals for the site; identified through user research, ethno/techno/psychographic, etc

### Site Objectives:

Business, creative, or other internally derived goals for the site

## Web as hypertext system (information-oriented)

### Visual Design

The visual treatment of text, graphic page elements and navigational components

### Navigation Design

Design of interface elements to facilitate the user's movement through the information architecture

### Information Design (In the Tuftean sense)

Designing the presentation of information to facilitate understanding

### Information Architecture

Structural design of the information space to facilitate intuitive access to content

### Content Requirements

Definition of content elements required in the site to meet user needs

### User Needs

Externally derived goals for the site; identified through user research, ethno/techno/psychographic, etc

### Site Objectives

Business, creative, or other internally derived goals for the site
