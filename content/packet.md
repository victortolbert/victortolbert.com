# Packet

A packet, or network packet, is a formatted chunk of data sent over a network. The main components of a network packet are the user data and control information. The user data is known as the _payload_. The control information is the information for delivering the payload. It consists of network addresses for the source and destination, sequencing information, and error detection codes and is generally found in packet headers and footer.
