"Passion"

Meet Victor

For two decades, I’ve been hard at work founding, growing, and selling delightful digital products that are used and loved by hundreds of thousands of creators across the web.

As a seasoned designer, I’m passionate about solving complex problems with pixels by combining research, clever technology, and thoughtful design. As a product engineer, I’m passionate about leading teams, leveling-up coworkers, and curating a culture of quality that breathes life into products and consistently drives results.

With this formula, I’ve launched and grown multiple projects from ground zero to over a million dollars in revenue before, ultimately, being acquired.

Most recently, I completed an impactful four-year run as a Principal Software Engineer at WP Engine, leading the effort to revolutionize WordPress with industry-leading design and dev tools.

And now, I'm back at building products and designing experiences full-time. I recently wrote my first book and course, I launched a new product brand, and started taking on select, high-impact design partnerships.

Off the clock, you can find me taking photos, exploring the cosmos, playing guitar and bass, making beats, woodworking, tinkering with electronics, and taking epic road trips with my wife, Mandi.

Using the word 'to' before a result can imply that the results were a goal and perhaps were not achieved. Instead, add 'ing' to your verb; this emphasizes and claims the result.

## When I say “impact”? Some questions you can ask yourself are:

-  What would have happened if you didn’t do this or didn’t do it well? Often your impact lies in the answer of that question.

You can also ask yourself, did you:

-   Reduce costs, increase revenues/profits? Impact bottom-line? (How?)
-   Meet/exceed company objectives? (In what way?)
-   Identify, create or implement a new procedure or system? (Results?)
-   Identify or solve a major problem for your department or division? (Results?)
-   Develop or do something for the first time at your company? (Results?)
-   Improve employee performance or productivity? (How?)
-   Receive any special recognition or awards? (Why?)
