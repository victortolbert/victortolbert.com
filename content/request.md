# Request

The Request interface of the [Fetch API](/fetch-api) represents a resource request.

You can create a new Request object using the [`Request()`][constructor] constructor, but you are more likely to encounter a Request object being returned as the result of another API operation, such as a service worker [`FetchEvent.request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent/request).
