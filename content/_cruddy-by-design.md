In 2017, a year before my first Laracon experience, I had the pleasure of watching an awesome talk by Adam Wathan titled _Cruddy By Design_. This talk has remained popular and widely shared online for years. In the spirit of knowledge-sharing, I'd like to summarize the key takeaways here for easy reference. Despite the fact that the video is now over six years old, I believe the ideas Adam shared remain as valuable as ever.

If you're interested, you can watch the full video of the talk on YouTube and let me know your thoughts. Enjoy!
