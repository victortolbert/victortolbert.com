var result = (
  from sa in ctx.ObjectContext.ServiceRegions
  where sa.Id == id
  select new ServiceRegionDTO {
    Id = sa.Id,
    Name = sa.Name,
    IsActive = sa.IsActive,
    IsCatastropheRegion = sa.IsCatastropheRegion,
    CreatedBy = sa.CreatedBy,
    CreatedOn = sa.CreatedOn,
    ModifiedBy = sa.CreatedBy,
    ModifiedOn = sa.CreatedOn,
    Timestamp = sa.RowVersion,
    RegionLeadId = sa.RegionLead,
    LeadName = sa.UserRegionLead.FirstName + " " + sa.UserRegionLead.LastName,
    IsDeleted = sa.IsDeleted
